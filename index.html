             DINO Hub is a digital platform merging photorealistic 3D product
             demos with interactive content. It is a virtual community where you
             can get up close and personal with DINO. Explore the DINO fleet,
             hop on the bus and tour our factory, and take part in DINO events –
             anytime, anywhere.</pre>

             Rural regions can still benefit most from digitization these days,
             because the issues of distance and the difficult accessibility of 
             customers and suppliers have driven existing analogue offers into
             the city.</pre>

             These dinosaur fun facts printables might be my favorite resource 
             (ETA: I wrote that *before* I finished my Solar System Fact Posters!).
             Teaching the dinosaur themed unit is the BEST! The children are all 
             so enthralled with the concept of these giant creatures roaming the 
             earth millions of years ago. Just look around on the website or my 
             TpT store and it’s pretty easy to see it’s one of my favorite themes 
             — from the dinosaur sensory box post and frozen dinosaur eggs to the
             playdough dinosaur post, my love of dinosaurs is apparent.</pre>
